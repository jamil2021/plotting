## MsL vs MsR Scatter Plot

This Python script generates a scatter plot comparing two datasets (`MsL` and `MsR`) and includes a line representing `MsR = MsL`. It can be used for data visualization and analysis tasks.

### Features

* Reads data from a tab-separated text file ("input.txt").
* Creates a scatter plot with blue data points and a red dashed line for `MsR = MsL`.
* Optionally separates and plots points above and below the `MsR = MsL` line with different markers.
* Generates a high-resolution publication-quality plot (PNG by default).

### Requirements

* Python 3.x
* pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
* matplotlib library (`pip install matplotlib`)
* numpy library (`pip install numpy`) (usually included with matplotlib)

### Usage

1. Save the script as `msl_vs_msr_scatter.py`.
2. Place your data in a tab-separated text file named "input.txt" with two columns: `MsL` and `MsR` (first row can be a header).
3. Run the script from your terminal: `python msl_vs_msr_scatter.py`
4. The output plot will be saved as "MsL_vs_MsR_scatter.png".

**Optional Customization:**

* Modify the script to change plot appearance (colors, markers, labels, etc.) using Matplotlib functionalities.
* Adjust the code to handle different data file formats or delimiters.

### Example Data

The script expects a tab-separated file like this (replace with your actual data):
